Tools and methods used in Cyber Crime
=====================================
Network attack incidents reveal that attackers are often very systematic in launching their 
attacks. The basic stages of an attack are described here to understand how an attacker can compromise a network here 
1. Initial Uncovering 
2. Network probe 
3. Crossing the line toward electronic crime (E-crime) 
4. Capturing the network 
5. Grab the data 
6. Covering tracks 

1. Initial Uncovering Two steps are involved here. In the ﬁrst step called as reconnaissance, the attacker gathers information, as 
much as possible, about the target by legitimate means – searching the information about the target on the Internet by Googling 
social networking websites and people ﬁnder websites. 

2. Network probe At the network probe stage, the attacker uses more invasive techniques to scan the information. Usually, a 
“ping sweep” of the network IP addresses is performed to seek out potential targets, and then a “port scanning” tool. 

3. Crossingthe line towardelectroniccrime (E-crime) Now the attacker is toward committing what is technically a “computer crime.” 
He/she does this by exploiting possible holes on the target system. 

4. Capturing thenetwork At this 
stage, the attacker attempts to “own” the network. The attacker gains a foothold in the internal network quickly and easily, by 
compromising low-priority target systems. The next step is to remove any evidence of the attack. 

5. Grab the data: Now that the attacker has “captured the network” he/she takes advantage of his/her positiontostealconﬁdentialdata, 
customercreditcardinformation, defacewebpages, alterprocesses and even launch attacks at other sites from your network, causing a 
potentially expensive and embarrassing situation for an individual and/or for anorganization. 

6. Covering tracks 
This is the last step in any cyber-attack, which refers to the activities undertaken by the attacker to extend misuse of the system 
without being detected.  

Proxy Servers and Anonymizers 
=============================
Proxy server is a computer on a network which acts as an intermediary for connections with other computers on that network. The 
attacker ﬁrst connects to a proxy server and establishes a connection with the target system through existing connection with proxy. 

A proxy server has following purposes: 
1. Keep the systems behind the curtain (mainly for securityreasons). 
2. Speed up access to a resource (through “caching”). It is usually used to cache the webpages from a web server. 
3. Specialized proxy servers are used to ﬁlter unwanted content such as advertisements. 
4. Proxyserver can be used as IP address multiplexer to enable to connect number ofcomputers onthe Internet, whenever one has only one
IP address.

One of the advantages of a proxy server is that its cache memory can serve all users. If one or more websites are requested
frequently, may be by diﬀerent users, it is likely to be in the proxy’s cache memory, which will improve user responsetime. Infact 
there are special servers available known as cache servers? A proxy can also do logging.

Proxy Servers:
==============
A proxy server is an intermediary server that seperates end users from the website they browse, proxy servers provides varying levels 
of functionality, security and privacy depending on your needs, company policies, or privacy concerns.

Functions of proxy servers:
===========================
Anonymity:
==========
By masking the users ip address, aproxy server helps to maintain user anonymity. this can be particularly useful for privacy-concious
users and organizations looking to protect their identity online.

Security:
=========
Proxy servers can act as a firewall and webfilter, providing additional security by blocking access to malicious websites and 
preventing attacks such as distributed denial of service(DDOS)

Content Filtering:
=================
Organizations use proxy servers to filter internet traffic, blocking access to certain websites or content deemed inappropriate or
dangerous.

Caching:
=======
Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed websites and content, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage.

Control:
=======
Organizations can monitor and control employee internet usage, ensuring compliance with the company policies and improving the 
productivity

Types of Proxy Servers:
=======================
Forward Proxy:
=============
used to forward requests from internal network users to the internet. it is commonly used in corporate networks to enforce internet 
usage policies and provide additional security

Reverse Proxy:
=============
Sits infront of the web server and forwards client requests to the appropriate backend server. it helps in load balancing, caching and
improving security.

Transparent Proxy:
=================
Intercepts requests without modifying them, often used for content filtering and caching without requiring any client side 
configuration 

Anonymous Proxy:
===============
Provides anonymity by hiding usres ip address, masking it difficult to trace the users online activity

Real-World Example:
===================
Imagine you are at a company where internet usage is monitored and restricted. To access a website that is blocked by your company’s 
network, you might use a proxy server.

How It Works:
=============
You configure your web browser to use a proxy server.
When you try to visit a blocked website, your request is first sent to the proxy server.
The proxy server then forwards your request to the target website.
The website's response goes back to the proxy server.
The proxy server sends the response back to you.

Example:
=======
Suppose you want to access "example.com" which is blocked at your workplace.

You set up a proxy server located in another country (e.g., UK).
You request "example.com" via the proxy server.
The proxy server (in the UK) fetches "example.com" on your behalf.
The content of "example.com" is sent back to your device through the proxy server.

Anonymizers
===========
An Anonymizers or an anonymous proxy is a tool that attempts to make activityon the Internet untraceable. It accesses the Internet on 
the user’s behalf, protecting personal information by hiding the source computer’s identifying information. 

An anonymizer is a tool that makes internet activity anonymous by routing the users traffic through different servers to hide ip 
address and encrypt their internet traffic.

Listed are few websites where more information about Anonymizers can be found: 
1. http://www.anonymizer.com 
2. http://www.browzar.com 
3. http://www.anonymize.net 
4. http://www.anonymouse.ws 
5. http://www.anonymousindex.com 

Functions of anonymizers:
========================
Privacy Protection
==================
Anonymizers help protect user privacy by masking their real IP address and encrypting their internet traffic, making it difficult for
websites and third parties to track their online activities.

Access to Restricted content:
=============================
Users can bypass geographic restrictions and censorship to access blocked websites and content by using anonymizers.

Data Protection:
================
Anonymizers provide an additional layer of security by encrypting data, protecting users from potential data breaches and surveillance

Tpes of Anonymizers
===================
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)
====
VPNs route internet traffic through encrypted tunnels, hiding the users IP address and securing their data. they are widely used for 
both privacy and security.

Tor (The Onion Router)
===
Tor routes internet traffic through a network of volunteer-operated servers (nodes) that encrypt the data multiple times. it provides
high levels of anonymity but may reduce browsing speed.

Web-based Anonymizers:
======================
These are websites that acts as proxies, allowing users to browse anonymously by entering the URL of the site they wish to visit.
they are easy to use but often offer limited functionality compared to VPN and Tor

Use Cases and Examples
=======================
Bypassing Geo-Restrictions:
===========================
Users in countries with strict internet censorship can use proxy servers or anonymizers to access restricted websites and content. 
For example, a user in China might use a VPN to access Google or YouTube.

Secure Remote Access:
=====================
Employees working remotely can use VPNs to securely connect to their company's network, ensuring their data is encrypted and protected
from potential threats.

Research and Investigations:
===========================
Researchers and investigators can use anonymizers to gather information without revealing their identity or location, protecting their
privacy and safety.

Protecting Sensitive Communications:
====================================
Journalists and activists can use tools like Tor to communicate securely and anonymously, protecting their sources and themselves from
surveillance and retaliation.

Best Practices for Using Proxy Servers and Anonymizers
======================================================
Choose Reliable Providers:
=========================
Use reputable proxy server and anonymizer providers to ensure data security and privacy.

Understand Limitations:
=======================
Be aware of the limitations and potential risks, such as reduced browsing speed with Tor or potential logging policies of some VPN 
providers.

Regularly Update Software:
==========================
Keep proxy server and anonymizer software up to date to protect against vulnerabilities and security threats.
Combine with Other Security Measures:

Use proxy servers and anonymizers in conjunction with other security measures, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and secure 
passwords, to enhance overall protection.

Anonymizer
===========
An anonymizer is a tool that makes your internet activity untraceable. It hides your IP address and encrypts your data to protect 
your identity and location.

Real-World Example:
Consider the Tor network (The Onion Router), which is a widely used anonymizer.

How It Works:
=============
When you use Tor, your internet traffic is routed through a series of volunteer-operated servers called nodes.
Each node only knows the IP address of the previous and next node, not the complete path.
Your data is encrypted multiple times and decrypted layer by layer at each node, which is why it’s called "Onion Routing".

Example:
========
You want to visit "example.com" anonymously to avoid being tracked by any entities.

You connect to the Tor network.
Your request to visit "example.com" is routed through several Tor nodes around the world.
Each node peels away a layer of encryption, revealing the next destination.
The final node (exit node) sends your request to "example.com".
"Example.com" sees the request coming from the Tor exit node, not from you.
The response is routed back through the Tor network to your device.
Comparison

Proxy:
======
Primarily used to bypass restrictions and filter content.
Hides your IP address but may not fully protect your privacy.
Easier to set up and usually faster.

Anonymizer (like Tor):
======================
Focuses on privacy and anonymity.
Routes traffic through multiple nodes to obscure your identity.
Can be slower due to multiple encryption layers and nodes.

Conclusion:
===========
Both proxies and anonymizers are used to conceal your IP address and location, but proxies are often simpler and faster, while 
anonymizers provide a higher level of privacy and security at the cost of speed.

Phishing Password Cracking
==========================
While checking electronic mail (E-Mail) one day a user ﬁnds a message from the bank threatening him/her to close the bank account if 
he/she does not reply immediately. Although the message seems to be suspicious from the contents of the message, it is diﬃcult to 
conclude that it is a fake/false E- Mail. It is believed that Phishing is an alternative spelling of “fishing,” as in “to fish for 
information.” The first documented use of the word “Phishing” was in 1996. 

Phishing is a cyber attack method where attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity to deceive individuals into providing 
sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details. Phishing attacks can occur via 
email, social media, phone calls, or fake websites.
 
1. How Phishing Works? 
======================
Phishers work in the following ways 

1. Planning: Criminals, usually called as phishers, decide the target and determine how to get E- Mail address of that target or 
customers of that business. Phishers often use mass mailing and address collection techniques as spammers. 

2. Setup: Once phishers know which business/business house to spoof and who their victims are, they will create methods for 
delivering the message and to collect the data about the target. Most often this involves E-Mail addresses and a webpage. 

3. Attack: This is the step people are most familiar with the phisher sends a phony message that appears to be from a reputable source.

4. Collection: Phishers record the information of victims entering into webpages or pop-up windows. 

5. Identity theft and fraud: Phishers use the information that they have gathered to make illegal purchases or commit fraud. 

Phishing started oﬀ as being part of popular hacking culture. Nowadays, more and more organizations/institutes provide greater online 
access for their customers and hence criminals are successfully using Phishing techniques to steal personal information and conduct 
ID theft at a global level. We have explained Phishing and Identity theft. 

Real-World Examples of Phishing:

The Sony Pictures Hack (2014):
==============================
Incident: Sony Pictures Entertainment suffered a major cyber attack where sensitive information, including employee emails, personal 
=========
data, and unreleased films, was leaked.

Phishing Vector: The attackers used spear-phishing emails that appeared to be from Apple, prompting recipients to enter their Apple ID
===============
and password. This allowed the hackers to gain access to the victims' accounts and move laterally within the network.

Google and Facebook Scam (2013-2015):
=====================================
Incident: A Lithuanian hacker tricked Google and Facebook into transferring over $100 million.
Phishing Vector: The attacker sent fake invoices to Google and Facebook employees that appeared to come from a legitimate hardware vendor. The emails included instructions to transfer funds to accounts controlled by the hacker.
John Podesta Email Phish (2016):

Incident: John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, had his email account compromised.
Phishing Vector: Podesta received a phishing email disguised as a security alert from Google, urging him to change his password. The email contained a malicious link, which led to the compromise of his email account when he followed the instructions.

2. Password Cracking 
====================
Password is like a key to get an entry into computerized systems like a lock. Password cracking is a process of recovering passwords 
from data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. 

Password Cracking refers to the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
Common methods include brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks.

The purpose of password cracking is as follows: 
1. To recover a forgotten password. 
2. As a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords. 
3. To gain unauthorized access to a system. 

Manual password cracking is to attempt to logon with diﬀerent passwords. The attacker follows the following steps 
	1. Find a valid user account such as an administrator or guest; 
	2. Create a list of possible passwords; 
	3. Rank the passwords from high to low probability; 
	4. Key-in each password; 
	5. Try again until a successful password is found. Passwords can be guessed sometimes with knowledge of the user’s personal 
	   information: 
		1. Blank (none); 
		2. The words like “password,” “passcode” and “admin”; 
		3. Series of letters from the “qwerty” keyboard, for example, qwerty, asdf or qwertyuiop. 
	4. User’s name or login name; 
	5. Name of user’s friend/relative/pet; 
	6. User’s birthplace or date of birth, or a relative’s or afriend’s; 
	7. User’s vehicle number, oﬃce number, residence number or mobile number; 
	8. Name of a celebrity who is considered to be an idol by the user; 
	9. Simple modiﬁcation of one of the preceding, such as suﬃxing a digit, particularly 1, or reversing the order of letters. 

Real-World Examples of Password Cracking:

LinkedIn Data Breach (2012):
Incident: Over 6.5 million LinkedIn user passwords were stolen and leaked online.
Cracking Method: The passwords were stored using an outdated hashing algorithm (SHA-1) without salting. Hackers used brute-force and 
dictionary attacks to crack a significant number of these hashes, exposing the plaintext passwords.

RockYou Hack (2009):
Incident: Social application developer RockYou experienced a data breach where over 32 million user accounts were exposed.
Cracking Method: The passwords were stored in plaintext, meaning they were not encrypted or hashed. Once the data was stolen, no 
additional cracking was necessary as the passwords were already in a readable format.

Adobe Systems Breach (2013):
Incident: Hackers accessed and stole data of 153 million Adobe accounts.
Cracking Method: The stolen passwords were encrypted but not hashed, and the encryption was poorly implemented. Hackers used a 
combination of known-plaintext attacks and other techniques to decrypt many of the passwords.

Online Attacks 
==============
An attacker can create a script ﬁle (i.e., automated program) that will be executed to try each password in a list and when matches, 
an attacker can gain the access to the system. The most popular online attack is man-in-the middle (MITM) attack, also termed as 
“bucket-brigade attack” or sometimes “Janus attack.” 

Offline Attacks 
===============
Mostly oﬄine attacks are performed from a location other than the target (i.e., either a computer system or while on the network) 
where these passwords reside or are used. 

Strong, Weak and Random Passwords 
=================================
A weak password is one, which could be easily guessed, short, common and a system default password that could be easily 
found byexecuting a brute force attack and byusing a subset of all possible passwords. 

Here are some of the examples of “weak passwords”:
1. Srinivas: Common personal name; 
2. aaaa: repeated letters, can be guessed; 
3. puppy: common name for a pet, also a dictionary word; 
4. abc123: can be easily guessed; 
5. admin: can be easily guessed; 
6. 1234: can be easily guessed; 
7. QWERTY: a sequence of adjacent letters on many keyboards; 
8. 12/3/24: date, possibly of personal importance; 
9. khitstd46: probably a username, and if so, can be very easily guessed; 
10. p@$$\/\/0rd: simple letter substitutions are preprogrammed into password cracking tools; 
11. password: used very often – trivially guessed; 
12. December12: using the date of a forced password change is very common. 

Here are some examples of strong passwords: 

1. Convert_£100 to Euros!: Such phrases are long, memorable and contain an extended symbol
to increase the strength of the password. 
2. 382465304H: It is mix of numbers and a letter at the end, usually used on mass user accounts and such passwords can be generated 
randomly. 
3. 4pRte!ai@3: It is not a dictionary word; however it has cases of alpha along with numeric and punctuation characters. 
4. MoOoOfIn245679: It is long with both alphabets and numerals. 
5. t3wahSetyeT4: It is not a dictionary word; however, it has both alphabets and numerals. 

Random Passwords
================
We have explained in the previous section how most secure passwords are long with random strings of characters and how such passwords 
are generally most diﬃcult to remember. Password is stronger if it includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and other 
symbols, when allowed, for the same number of characters. 

The general guidelines applicable to the password policies, which can be implemented 
organization-wide, are as follows: 
1. Passwords and user logon identities (IDs) should be unique to each authorized user. 
2. Passwords should consist of a minimum of eight alphanumeric characters. 
3. There should be computer-controlled lists of prescribed password rules and periodic testing to identify any password weaknesses. 
4. Passwords should be kept private, that is, not shared with friends, colleagues. 
5. Passwords shall be changed every 30/45 days or less. 
6. User accounts should be frozen after ﬁve failed logon attempts. 
7. Sessions should be suspended after 15 minutes (or other speciﬁed period) of inactivity and require the passwords to be re-entered. 
8. Successful logons should display the date and time of the last logon and logoﬀ. 
9. Logon IDs and passwords should be suspended after a speciﬁed period of non-use. 
10. For high-risk systems, after excessive violations, the system should generate an alarm and be able to simulate a continuing 
session (with dummy data) for the failed user.
